# ADDIDAS-SALES-DASHBOARD.

In this project, I created an adidas sales Dashboard using MS Excel to answer some business problems.

Some of the insights derived from the analysis and Dashboard are as follows:

1. Which products contributed more to revenue?
2. What is the peak month for 2020 and 2021?
3. What's our top Region & Sales channel
4. Whu
5. Which state should we push more products to?

The above questions were answered from the interactive Dashboard.
